# Terracini's Lemma in Lean 4

A formalization of Terracini's Lemma in [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/) using [Mathlib4](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/).

## The Theorem

**Terracini's Lemma** (1911) is a fundamental result in the theory of secant varieties. Given an irreducible projective variety $X \subset \mathbb{P}^N$, its *$r$-th secant variety* $\sigma_r(X)$ is the Zariski closure of the union of all $(r-1)$-planes spanned by $r$ points of $X$. Terracini's Lemma computes the tangent space to $\sigma_r(X)$ at a general point:

> **Theorem.** For general points $p_1, \ldots, p_r \in X$ and a general point $p \in \langle p_1, \ldots, p_r \rangle$,
> $$T_p\,\sigma_r(X) = \langle T_{p_1}X,\, \ldots,\, T_{p_r}X \rangle.$$

Here $T_{p_i}X$ denotes the embedded tangent space to $X$ at $p_i$ inside $\mathbb{P}^N$, and the right-hand side is their linear span.

This lemma is the primary tool for computing dimensions of secant varieties. For example, the expected dimension of $\sigma_r(X)$ is $\min(N, r(\dim X + 1) - 1)$; a variety is *defective* when $\sigma_r(X)$ falls short of this, and Terracini's Lemma localizes that deficiency to the tangent geometry.

## Strategy

We work with the **affine cone** $\hat X \subseteq V$ over $\mathbb{P}(V)$. The $r$-th secant variety of $\hat X$ is

$$\hat\sigma_r(\hat X) = \overline{\{v_1 + \cdots + v_r \mid v_i \in \hat X\}}.$$

The key player is the **combined parametrization**

$$\Phi : \mathbb{A}^r \to V, \qquad \Phi(u_1,\ldots,u_r) = \sum_{i=1}^r f_i(u_i),$$

where each $f_i : \mathbb{A} \to V$ is a local smooth parametrization of $\hat X$ near $v_i = f_i(u_i^0)$.

The proof has two parts of very different character:

| Part | Content | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **A** | $d\Phi_{u^0} = \sum_i Df_i \circ \pi_i$, so $\operatorname{Im}(d\Phi) = T_{v_1}\hat X + \cdots + T_{v_r}\hat X$ | **Proved** (chain rule) |
| **B** | $T_{\sum v_i}\,\hat\sigma_r(\hat X) = \operatorname{Im}(d\Phi)$ for general points | **Assumed** (generic smoothness) |

Part A is a straightforward chain-rule calculation. Part B requires the *generic smoothness theorem*: a dominant morphism of smooth irreducible varieties in characteristic zero has surjective differential at general points. This theorem is not yet in Mathlib, so it is split into two hypotheses:

- $\operatorname{Im}(d\Phi) \subseteq T$ (`hdominant`), which holds simply because $\Phi$ maps into $\hat\sigma_r(\hat X)$ — easy in any setting;
- $\dim T \le \dim \operatorname{Im}(d\Phi)$ (`hgeneric`), a dimension count (in practice obtained from a Jacobian-rank computation), which is the actual content of generic smoothness in characteristic zero.

Together these force $\operatorname{Im}(d\Phi) = T$ by a finite-dimensional submodule-equality lemma (`Submodule.eq_of_le_of_finrank_le`) — no containment in the "hard" direction needs to be assumed directly.

## File Overview

The mathematics is organized into five files:

- [`TerraciniLemma.lean`](TerraciniLemma.lean) — top-level module: imports the
  files below and gives the overall statement, file organization, and a
  summary table of proof obligations.
- [`TerraciniLemma/Core.lean`](TerraciniLemma/Core.lean) — the general theory
  (§1–§6 below): the addition map, the Terracini derivative computation,
  secant varieties, smooth local parametrizations (`LocalParam`), and
  `terraciniLemma` itself.
- [`TerraciniLemma/Veronese.lean`](TerraciniLemma/Veronese.lean) — worked
  examples for Veronese varieties (currently the plane conic `v₂(ℙ¹) ⊂ ℙ²`).
- [`TerraciniLemma/Segre.lean`](TerraciniLemma/Segre.lean) — worked examples
  for Segre varieties: the non-defective Segre quadric `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹ ⊂ ℙ³` and the
  defective Segre threefold `ℙ¹ × ℙ¹ × ℙ¹ ⊂ ℙ⁷`.
- [`TerraciniLemma/EllipticCurve.lean`](TerraciniLemma/EllipticCurve.lean) —
  a worked example for the elliptic curve `y² = x³ + 1`. Unlike the
  Veronese/Segre examples, this curve has no global rational
  parametrization, so the local charts at each point are instead built from
  Mathlib's Implicit Function Theorem.

The sections below (§1–§6) all live in `TerraciniLemma/Core.lean`.

### §1 — The addition map
```
additionMap r : (Fin r → E) →L[𝕜] E
```
The map $v \mapsto \sum_i v_i$ is continuous and $\mathbb{k}$-linear, hence its own Fréchet derivative everywhere.

### §2 — The Terracini computation
```
hasFDerivAt_combinedParam   -- dΦ = ∑ Dfᵢ ∘ πᵢ  (chain rule)
range_combinedParam_eq_iSup -- Im(dΦ) = ⨆ Im(Dfᵢ)  (submodule algebra)
```
The core result: the image of the derivative of $\Phi$ is exactly the sum of the individual tangent spaces. Both directions of the equality are fully proved.

### §3 — Secant varieties
```
secantSet r X      -- { v₁ + ⋯ + vᵣ | vᵢ ∈ X }
secantVariety r X  -- closure of the above
```
Basic lemmas: `secantVariety 1 X = X` (for closed `X`), monotonicity in `r`.

### §4 — Smooth parametrizations
```
structure LocalParam (X : Set E) (x : E) where
  basePoint : 𝔸
  chart     : 𝔸 → E
  chart_eval : chart basePoint = x
  tangent   : 𝔸 →L[𝕜] E
  hasFDerivAt : HasFDerivAt chart tangent basePoint
```
Models a smooth local parametrization of `X` at a point `x`, together with its derivative (= embedded tangent space generator).

### §5 — Terracini's Lemma
```
terraciniLemma          -- T = ⨆ tangentSpace (param i),  given hgeneric + hdominant
terraciniLemma_derivative  -- HasFDerivAt of combined parametrization
```
The main theorem (in finite dimension) takes two hypotheses that together encode generic smoothness:
- `hdominant : Im(dΦ) ≤ T` — the image of $d\Phi$ lands in the tangent space (because $\Phi$ maps into $\hat\sigma_r(\hat X)$);
- `hgeneric : finrank T ≤ finrank Im(dΦ)` — a dimension count (characteristic-zero, Jacobian-rank input).

From these, `Submodule.eq_of_le_of_finrank_le` gives $T = \operatorname{Im}(d\Phi)$, and Part A then gives $T = \bigsqcup_i T_{v_i}\hat X$.

### §6 — The projective formulation
Sketch of how the affine cone result descends to the projective statement via `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Projectivization`. Not yet formalized.

## Sorry Inventory

There is exactly one gap in the formalization.

**Generic smoothness.**  
Assumed as explicit hypotheses `hgeneric` and `hdominant` in `terraciniLemma`. Formalizing this would require either:
- A general generic smoothness theorem in Mathlib (not yet present), or
- A case-by-case argument for specific varieties of interest.

(The range theorem `range_combinedParam_eq_iSup` is fully proved in both directions: the ≥ direction follows by taking, for $y = Df_i(a) \in \operatorname{Im}(Df_i)$, the input $u = \text{Pi.single } i\ a$, whose other coordinates vanish so that $d\Phi(u) = Df_i(a) = y$.)

## Building

```bash
# Install the Lean toolchain (elan downloads it automatically if needed)
elan toolchain install leanprover/lean4:v4.30.0-rc2

# Fetch prebuilt Mathlib compiled objects (~1 GB)
lake exe cache get

# Check the file
lake build TerraciniLemma
```

The project uses Mathlib at tag `v4.30.0-rc2`. The `lake exe cache get` step is strongly recommended — building Mathlib from source takes several hours.
